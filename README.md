# [Robot Name] - [Competition Type] Repository

Welcome to the **[Robot Name]** repository for the [Competition Name] (e.g., Sumo, MicroMouse, Combat) at the National Robotics Competition (NRC). This repository is organized into three main directories: **Software**, **Hardware**, and **Electrical**. Each team should contribute to their respective sections, ensuring that all documentation is kept up to date.

## Overview

This project is focused on building a **[Robot Type]** robot for the [Competition Type] at NRC. The robot is designed to perform the following tasks:

- [Robot’s goals and tasks, e.g., push an opponent out of the sumo ring, autonomously navigate a maze, or engage in combat with another robot].

### Goals

- **[Goal 1]**: [e.g., Develop efficient control systems for autonomous behavior].
- **[Goal 2]**: [e.g., Design and build a durable robot chassis with optimized weight and strength].
- **[Goal 3]**: [e.g., Power the robot efficiently while managing high motor torque].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start working on this project, make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- [Programming language and version] (e.g., Python 3.8, C++ 14)
- [Hardware tools] (e.g., Arduino IDE, ROS, Fusion 360)
- [Specific Libraries] (e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV for image processing)
- [Other dependencies]

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/[robot-name].git
```

### Directory Breakdown

#### 1. `software/`:

This folder contains all the code for controlling the robot, sensor integration, and algorithms such as pathfinding and decision-making.

- **Control System**: Contains the core logic to control the robot’s movements.
- **Navigation (if applicable)**: Handles pathfinding and obstacle avoidance algorithms (used in MicroMouse).
- **Sensors**: Code for integrating sensors like ultrasonic, IR, or other proximity sensors.

To contribute to the software, check out the [Software Team README](./software/README.md) for instructions on setting up the development environment, coding standards, and how to submit changes.

#### 2. `hardware/`:

The hardware folder includes all the CAD models, 3D printing files, and assembly instructions for the robot.

- **CAD Models**: Design files for the robot’s mechanical structure.
- **3D Printing**: STL files for any parts that need to be 3D printed.
- **Assembly**: Instructions and diagrams for assembling the robot.

For more details on contributing to the hardware designs, see the [Hardware Team README](./hardware/README.md).

#### 3. `electrical/`:

This folder contains the robot’s circuit diagrams, motor driver setups, and battery management systems.

- **Schematics**: Circuit diagrams for the robot’s power distribution and control systems.
- **Motor Control**: Code and wiring diagrams for the robot’s motors.
- **Battery Management**: Systems for managing power flow to motors and sensors.

Refer to the [Electrical Team README](./electrical/README.md) for further details on contributing to the electrical systems.
